This is a simple Movie Search web application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML file provides the basic structure, including a search input box, a search button, an error message section, and a container to display movie results. The CSS file (movie.css) is used to design a clean and attractive layout, style the search area, and arrange movie cards in an organized format. The JavaScript file (movie.js) adds functionality by fetching movie data from an external API based on the user’s search input and displaying details such as movie title, poster, and other information. It also shows an error message if no results are found. This project demonstrates API integration, DOM manipulation, event handling, and dynamic content rendering in a simple and practical way.
